# Redbeansoup-soup

> *Don't blame me for the name...*

This is an attempt to create a discord bot framework built on top of discordeno, while rewriting redbeansoup-bot.

This is a personnal project. Since I cannot warranty I will maintain it, it don't recommand to include this project as a dependancy.

Instead, look at other frameworks (like [oasis](https://github.com/yuzudev/oasis)) or just take inspiration + copy paste from this repository.
